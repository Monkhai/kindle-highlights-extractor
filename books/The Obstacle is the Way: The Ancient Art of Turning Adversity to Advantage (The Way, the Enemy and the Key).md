# The Obstacle is the Way: The Ancient Art of Turning Adversity to Advantage (The Way, the Enemy and the Key)

- Our actions may be impeded… but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.
- The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.
- in Marcus we find a man who held the highest and most powerful station in the world—and the universal verdict of the people around him was that he proved himself worthy of it.
- Whatever we face, we have a choice: Will we be blocked by obstacles, or will we advance through and over them?
- We might not be emperors, but the world is still constantly testing us. It asks: Are you worthy? Can you get past the things that inevitably fall in your way? Will you stand up and show us what you’re made of?
- This thing in front of you. This issue. This obstacle—this frustrating, unfortunate, problematic, unexpected problem preventing you from doing what you want to do. That thing you dread or secretly hope will never happen. What if it wasn’t so bad? What if embedded inside it or inherent in it were certain benefits—benefits only for you? What would you do? What do you think most people would do?
- How skilled we are at cataloging what holds us back!
- “Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.”
- As it turns out, this is one thing all great men and women of history have in common. Like oxygen to a fire, obstacles became fuel for the blaze that was their ambition.
- It’s not just: How can I think this is not so bad? No, it is how to will yourself to see that this must be good—an opportunity to gain a new foothold, move forward, or go in a better direction. Not “be positive” but learn to be ceaselessly creative and opportunistic. Not: This is not so bad. But: I can make this good.
- “The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.”
- When you have a goal, obstacles are actually teaching you how to get where you want to go—carving you a path.
- Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance—now at this very moment—of all external events. That’s all you need. — MARCUS AURELIUS
- Overcoming obstacles is a discipline of three critical steps. It begins with how we look at our specific problems, our attitude or approach; then the energy and creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities; finally, the cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty. It’s three interdependent, interconnected, and fluidly contingent disciplines: Perception, Action, and the Will.
- Because obstacles are not only to be expected but embraced.
- WHAT IS PERCEPTION? It’s how we see and understand what occurs around us—and what we decide those events will mean.
- lives. It takes skill and discipline to bat away the pests of bad perceptions, to separate reliable signals from deceptive ones, to filter out prejudice, expectation, and fear. But it’s worth it, for what’s left is truth.
- “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”
- You will come across obstacles in life—fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure.
- Too often we react emotionally, get despondent, and lose our perspective. All that does is turn bad things into really bad things.
- we carry all kinds of biological baggage. Humans are still primed to detect threats and dangers that no longer exist—think of the cold sweat when you’re stressed about money, or the fight-or-flight response that kicks in when your boss yells at you. Our safety is not truly at risk here—there is little danger that we will starve or that violence will break out—though it certainly feels that way sometimes.
- There are a few things to keep in mind when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. We must try: To be objective To control emotions and keep an even keel To choose to see the good in a situation To steady our nerves To ignore what disturbs or limits others To place things in perspective To revert to the present moment To focus on what can be controlled
- Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been. —MARCUS AURELIUS
- This can’t harm me—I might not have wanted it to happen, but I decide how it will affect me. No one else has the right. We decide what we will make of each and every situation. We decide whether we’ll break or whether we’ll resist. We decide whether we’ll assent or reject. No one can force us to give up or to believe something that is untrue (such as, that a situation is absolutely hopeless or impossible to improve). Our perceptions are the thing that we’re in complete control of. They can throw us in jail, label us, deprive us of our possessions, but they’ll never control our thoughts, our beliefs, our reactions.
- situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad. This is something—a judgment—that we, as human beings, bring to them with our perceptions.
- “Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,” as Shakespeare put it.
- This is how obstacles become obstacles. In other words, through our perception of events, we are complicit in the creation—as well as the destruction—of every one of our obstacles.
- There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means.
- A mistake becomes training.
- Regardless of how much actual danger we’re in, stress puts us at the potential whim of our baser—fearful—instinctual reactions.
- Defiance and acceptance come together well in the following principle: There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it.
- When people panic, they make mistakes. They override systems. They disregard procedures, ignore rules. They deviate from the plan. They become unresponsive and stop thinking clearly. They just react—not to what they need to react to, but to the survival hormones that are coursing through their veins.
- Uncertainty and fear are relieved by authority. Training is authority. It’s a release valve. With enough exposure, you can adapt out those perfectly ordinary, even innate, fears that are bred mostly from unfamiliarity.
- Obstacles make us emotional, but the only way we’ll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check—if we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate.
- “When you worry, ask yourself, ‘What am I choosing to not see right now?’ What important things are you missing because you chose worry over introspection, alertness or wisdom?”
- Real strength lies in the control or, as Nassim Taleb put it, the domestication of one’s emotions, not in pretending they don’t exist.
- We defeat emotions with logic, or at least that’s the idea. Logic is questions and statements. With enough of them, we get to root causes
- Does what happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness? Nope. Then get back to work!
- Don’t let the force of an impression when it first hit you knock you off your feet; just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test. — EPICTETUS
- The phrase “This happened and it is bad” is actually two impressions. The first—“This happened”—is objective. The second—“it is bad”—is subjective.
- the observing eye sees simply what is there. The perceiving eye sees more than what is there.
- To paraphrase Nietzsche, sometimes being superficial—taking things only at first glance—is the most profound approach.
- But this takes strength. It’s a muscle that must be developed. And muscles are developed by tension, by lifting and holding.
- Marcus Aurelius had a version of this exercise where he’d describe glamorous or expensive things without their euphemisms—roasted meat is a dead animal and vintage wine is old, fermented grapes. The aim was to see these things as they really are, without any of the ornamentation.
- Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. — VIKTOR FRANKL
- Perspective is everything. That is, when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you.
- The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore fear but to explain it away.
- It’s your choice whether you want to put I in front of something (I hate public speaking. I screwed up. I am harmed by this). These add an extra element: you in relation to that obstacle, rather than just the obstacle itself.
- Perspective has two definitions. Context: a sense of the larger picture of the world, not just what is immediately in front of us Framing: an individual’s unique way of looking at the world, a way that interprets its events
- Where the head goes, the body follows. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective.
- In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices. — EPICTETUS
- God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.
- Behind the Serenity Prayer is a two-thousand-year-old Stoic phrase: “ta eph’hemin, ta ouk eph’hemin.” What is up to us, what is not up to us. And what is up to us? Our emotions Our judgments Our creativity Our attitude Our perspective Our desires Our decisions Our determination This is our playing field, so to speak. Everything there is fair game. What is not up to us? Well, you know, everything else.
- If what’s up to us is the playing field, then what is not up to us are the rules and conditions of the game.
- To see an obstacle as a challenge, to make the best of it anyway, that is also a choice—a choice that is up to us.
- The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close up. — CHUCK PALAHNIUK
- Yet in our own lives, we aren’t content to deal with things as they happen. We have to dive endlessly into what everything “means,” whether something is “fair” or not, what’s “behind” this or that, and what everyone else is doing. Then we wonder why we don’t have the energy to actually deal with our problems.
- Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead.
- A business must take the operating constraints of the world around it as a given and work for whatever gains are possible.
- It doesn’t matter whether this is the worst time to be alive or the best, whether you’re in a good job market or a bad one, or that the obstacle you face is intimidating or burdensome. What matters is that right now is right now. The implications of our obstacle are theoretical—they exist in the past and the future. We live in the moment. And the more we embrace that, the easier the obstacle will be to face and move.
- Genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind. There’s no other definition of it. — F. SCOTT FITZGERALD
- though our doubts (and self-doubts) feel real, they have very little bearing on what is and isn’t possible.
- Our perceptions determine, to an incredibly large degree, what we are and are not capable of. In many ways, they determine reality itself. When we believe in the obstacle more than in the goal, which will inevitably triumph?
- An entrepreneur is someone with faith in their ability to make something where there was nothing before.
- When given an unfair task, some rightly see it as a chance to test what they’re made of—to give it all they’ve got, knowing full well how difficult it will be to win. They see it as an opportunity because it is often in that desperate nothing-to-lose state that we are our most creative.
- A good person dyes events with his own color… and turns whatever happens to his own benefit. — SENECA
- It’s one thing to not be overwhelmed by obstacles, or discouraged or upset by them. This is something that few are able to do. But after you have controlled your emotions, and you can see objectively and stand steadily, the next step becomes possible: a mental flip, so you’re looking not at the obstacle but at the opportunity within it.
- If you mean it when you say you’re at the end of your rope and would rather quit, you actually have a unique chance to grow and improve yourself. A unique opportunity to experiment with different solutions, to try different tactics, or to take on new projects to add to your skill set.
- antilog—an example of whom you don’t want to become
- Psychologists call it adversarial growth and post-traumatic growth. “That which doesn’t kill me makes me stronger” is not a cliché but fact.
- Everything can be flipped, seen with this kind of gaze: a piercing look that ignores the package and sees only the gift.
- Behind the behaviors that provoke an immediate negative reaction is opportunity—some exposed benefit that we can seize mentally and then act upon.
- Problems are rarely as bad as we think—or rather, they are precisely as bad as we think.
- The demand on you is this: Once you see the world as it is, for what it is, you must act. The proper perception—objective, rational, ambitious, clean—isolates the obstacle and exposes it for what it is.
- A clearer head makes for steadier hands.
- But boldness is acting anyway, even though you understand the negative and the reality of your obstacle.
- force. Our movements and decisions define us: We must be sure to act with deliberation, boldness, and persistence. Those are the attributes of right and effective action.
- Action is the solution and the cure to our predicaments.
- as though we honestly believe that there is a chance of obstacles unobstacle-ing themselves.
- We forget: In life, it doesn’t matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you’ve been given. And the only way you’ll do something spectacular is by using it all to your advantage.
- And if we’d like to go where we claim we want to go—to accomplish what we claim are our goals—there is only one way. And that’s to meet our problems with the right action. Therefore, we can always (and only) greet our obstacles with energy with persistence with a coherent and deliberate process with iteration and resilience with pragmatism with strategic vision with craftiness and savvy and an eye for opportunity and pivotal moments Are you ready to get to work?
- We must all either wear out or rust out, every one of us. My choice is to wear out. — THEODORE ROOSEVELT
- So the first step is: Take the bat off your shoulder and give it a swing. You’ve got to start, to go anywhere.
- That’s the next step: ramming your feet into the stirrups and really going for it.
- While you’re sleeping, traveling, attending meetings, or messing around online, the same thing is happening to you. You’re going soft. You’re not aggressive enough.
- And that’s the final part: Stay moving, always.
- If you haven’t even tried yet, then of course you will still be in the exact same place. You haven’t actually pursued anything.
- Just as Earhart did, all the greats you admire started by saying, Yes, let’s go.
- He says the best way out is always through And I agree to that, or in so far As I can see no way out but through. —ROBERT FROST
- If we’re to overcome our obstacles, this is the message to broadcast—internally and externally. We will not be stopped by failure, we will not be rushed or distracted by external noise. We will chisel and peg away at the obstacle until it is gone. Resistance is futile.
- genius often really is just persistence in disguise.
- The thing standing in your way isn’t going anywhere. You’re not going to outthink it or outcreate it with some world-changing epiphany. You’ve got to look at it and the people around you, who have begun their inevitable chorus of doubts and excuses, and say, as Margaret Thatcher famously did: “You turn if you want to. The lady’s not for turning.”
- Working at it works. It’s that simple.
- Consider this mind-set. never in a hurry never worried never desperate never stopping short
- Epictetus: “persist and resist.” Persist in your efforts. Resist giving in to distraction, discouragement, or disorder.
- There’s no need to sweat this or feel rushed. No need to get upset or despair. You’re not going anywhere—you’re not going to be counted out. You’re in this for the long haul.
- only by persisting and resisting can we learn what others were too impatient to be taught.
- Stop looking for an epiphany, and start looking for weak points. Stop looking for angels, and start looking for angles.
- What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first steps to something better. — WENDELL PHILLIPS
- Failure is a Feature.
- In a world where we increasingly work for ourselves, are responsible for ourselves, it makes sense to view ourselves like a start-up—a start-up of one.
- When failure does come, ask: What went wrong here? What can be improved? What am I missing? This helps birth alternative ways of doing what needs to be done, ways that are often much better than what we started with. Failure puts you in corners you have to think your way out of. It is a source of breakthroughs.
- They slip many times, but they don’t fall.
- Like any good school, learning from failure isn’t free. The tuition is paid in discomfort or loss and having to start over.
- It’s time you understand that the world is telling you something with each and every failure and action. It’s feedback—giving you precise instructions on how to improve, it’s trying to wake you up from your cluelessness. It’s trying to teach you something. Listen.
- Failure shows us the way—by showing us what isn’t the way.
- In the chaos of sport, as in life, process provides us a way.
- Excellence is a matter of steps. Excelling at this one, then that one, and then the one after that.
- The process is about finishing. Finishing games. Finishing workouts. Finishing film sessions. Finishing drives. Finishing reps. Finishing plays. Finishing blocks. Finishing the smallest task you have right in front of you and finishing it well.
- Being trapped is just a position, not a fate. You get out of it by addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small, deliberate actions—not by trying (and failing) to push it away with superhuman strength.
- The process is about doing the right things, right now.
- Whatever is rightly done, however humble, is noble. (Quidvis recte factum quamvis humile praeclarum.) — SIR HENRY ROYCE
- Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires.
- Wherever we are, whatever we’re doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our art, to the world to do it well. That’s our primary duty. And our obligation. When action is our priority, vanity falls away.
- Each project matters, and the only degrading part is giving less than one is capable of giving.
- To whatever we face, our job is to respond with: hard work honesty helping others as best we can You should never have to ask yourself, But what am I supposed to do now? Because you know the answer: your job.
- The great psychologist Viktor Frankl, survivor of three concentration camps, found presumptuousness in the age-old question: “What is the meaning of life?” As though it is someone else’s responsibility to tell you. Instead, he said, the world is asking you that question. And it’s your job to answer with your actions.
- In every situation, life is asking us a question, and our actions are the answer. Our job is simply to answer well.
- How you do anything is how you can do everything. We can always act right.
- The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out. There are brambles in the path? Then go around. That’s all you need to know. — MARCUS AURELIUS
- Forget the rule book, settle the issue.
- Sometimes you do it this way. Sometimes that way. Not deploying the tactics you learned in school but adapting them to fit each and every situation. Any way that works—that’s the motto.
- We tell ourselves that we’ll get started once the conditions are right, or once we’re sure we can trust this or that. When, really, it’d be better to focus on making due with what we’ve got. On focusing on results instead of pretty methods.
- Pragmatism is not so much realism as flexibility. There are a lot of ways to get from point A to point B. It doesn’t have to be a straight line.
- Deng Xiaoping once said, “I don’t care if the cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice.”
- What mattered was that you got it done and it worked.
- Start thinking like a radical pragmatist: still ambitious, aggressive, and rooted in ideals, but also imminently practical and guided by the possible. Not on everything you would like to have, not on changing the world right at this moment, but ambitious enough to get everything you need. Don’t think small, but make the distinction between the critical and the extra. Think progress, not perfection.
- In a study of some 30 conflicts comprising more than 280 campaigns from ancient to modern history, the brilliant strategist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart came to a stunning conclusion: In only 6 of the 280 campaigns was the decisive victory a result of a direct attack on the enemy’s main army.
- If we’re starting from scratch and the established players have had time to build up their defenses, there is just no way we are going to beat them on their strengths. So it’s smarter to not even try, but instead focus our limited resources elsewhere.
- The inertia of success makes it much harder to truly develop good technique.
- We’re in the game of little defeating big. Therefore, Force can’t try to match Force.
- Of course, when pushed, the natural instinct is always to push back. But martial arts teach us that we have to ignore this impulse. We can’t push back, we have to pull until opponents lose their balance. Then we make our move.
- The art of the side-door strategy is a vast, creative space. And it is by no means limited to war, business, or sales.
- Wise men are able to make a fitting use even of their enmities. —PLUTARCH
- Sometimes you overcome obstacles not by attacking them but by withdrawing and letting them attack you.
- So instead of fighting obstacles, find a means of making them defeat themselves.
- Yes, sometimes we need to learn from Amelia Earhart and just take action. But we also have to be ready to see that restraint might be the best action for us to take.
- Sometimes a problem needs less of you—fewer people period—and not more.
- We wrongly assume that moving forward is the only way to progress, the only way we can win. Sometimes, staying put, going sideways, or moving backward is actually the best way to eliminate what blocks or impedes your path.
- Passive resistance is, in fact, incredibly active. But those actions come in the form of discipline, self-control, fearlessness, determination, and grand strategy.
- The great strategist Saul Alinsky believed that if you “push a negative hard enough and deep enough it will break through into its counterside.” Every positive has its negative. Every negative has its positive. The action is in the pushing through—all the way through to the other side. Making a negative into a positive.
- When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstance revert at once to yourself and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better grasp of harmony if you keep going back to it. — MARCUS AURELIUS
- Adversity can harden you. Or it can loosen you up and make you better—if you let it.
- Instead of giving in to frustration, we can put it to good use. It can power our actions, which, unlike our disposition, become stronger and better when loose and bold. While others obsess with observing the rules, we’re subtly undermining them and subverting them to our advantage.
- External factors influence the path, but not the direction: forward.
- The best men are not those who have waited for chances but who have taken them; besieged chance, conquered the chance, and made chance the servitor. — E. H. CHAPIN
- If you think it’s simply enough to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in your life, you will fall short of greatness. Anyone sentient can do that. What you must do is learn how to press forward precisely when everyone around you sees disaster.
- “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. Things that we had postponed for too long, that were long-term, are now immediate and must be dealt with. [A] crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.”
- Every chemical reaction requires a catalyst. Let this be yours.
- Life speeds on the bold and favors the brave.
- At certain moments in our brief existences we are faced with great trials. Often those trials are frustrating, unfortunate, or unfair. They seem to come exactly when we think we need them the least. The question is: Do we accept this as an exclusively negative event, or can we get past whatever negativity or adversity it represents and mount an offensive? Or more precisely, can we see that this “problem” presents an opportunity for a solution that we have long been waiting for? If you don’t take that, it’s on you.
- Great commanders look for decision points. For it is bursts of energy directed at decisive points that break things wide open. They press and press and press and then, exactly when the situation seems hopeless—or, more likely, hopelessly deadlocked—they press once more.
- In the meantime, cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, not to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases. —SENECA
- Perceptions can be managed. Actions can be directed. We can always think clearly, respond creatively. Look for opportunity, seize the initiative.
- Nothing can ever prevent us from trying. Ever.
- In every situation, that which blocks our path actually presents a new path with a new part of us. If someone you love hurts you, there is a chance to practice forgiveness. If your business fails, now you can practice acceptance. If there is nothing else you can do for yourself, at least you can try to help others.
- We have it within us to be the type of people who try to get things done, try with everything we’ve got and, whatever verdict comes in, are ready to accept it instantly and move on to whatever is next.
- Placed in some situation that seems unchangeable and undeniably negative, we can turn it into a learning experience, a humbling experience, a chance to provide comfort to others. That’s will power. But that needs to be cultivated.
- True will is quiet humility, resilience, and flexibility; the other kind of will is weakness disguised by bluster and ambition. See which lasts longer under the hardest of obstacles.
- Of course, we try—because it can happen.
- we need to be able to find a greater purpose in this suffering and handle it with firmness and forbearance.
- If Perception and Action were the disciplines of the mind and the body, then Will is the discipline of the heart and the soul.
- sustine et abstine. Bear and forbear. Acknowledge the pain but trod onward in your task.
- Certain things in life will cut you open like a knife. When that happens—at that exposing moment—the world gets a glimpse of what’s truly inside you. So what will be revealed when you’re sliced open by tension and pressure? Iron? Or air?
- The will is what prepares us for this, protects us against it, and allows us to thrive and be happy in spite of it. It is also the most difficult of all the disciplines. It’s what allows us to stand undisturbed while others wilt and give in to disorder. Confident, calm, ready to work regardless of the conditions. Willing and able to continue, even during the unthinkable, even when our worst nightmares have come true.
- In every situation, we can Always prepare ourselves for more difficult times. Always accept what we’re unable to change. Always manage our expectations. Always persevere. Always learn to love our fate and what happens to us. Always protect our inner self, retreat into ourselves. Always submit to a greater, larger cause. Always remind ourselves of our own mortality. And, of course, prepare to start the cycle once more.
- If thy faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.
- (mens sana in corpore sano—sound mind in a strong body).
- the Inner Citadel, that fortress inside of us that no external adversity can ever break down.
- We protect our inner fortress so it may protect us.
- You’ll have far better luck toughening yourself up than you ever will trying to take the teeth out of a world that is—at best—indifferent to your existence.
- the observation that the way to strengthen an arch is to put weight on it—because it binds the stones together, and only with tension does it hold weight—
- A premortem is different. In it, we look to envision what could go wrong, what will go wrong, in advance, before we start.
- premeditatio malorum (premeditation of evils). A writer like Seneca would begin by reviewing or rehearsing his plans, say, to take a trip. And then he would go over, in his head (or in writing), the things that could go wrong or prevent it from happening: a storm could arise, the captain could fall ill, the ship could be attacked by pirates. “Nothing happens to the wise man against his expectation,” he wrote to a friend. “… nor do all things turn out for him as he wished but as he reckoned—and above all he reckoned that something could block his plans.”
- What if… Then I will… What if… Instead I’ll just… What if… No problem, we can always… And in the case where nothing could be done, the Stoics would use it as an important practice to do something the rest of us too often fail to do: manage expectations.
- four. The only guarantee, ever, is that things will go wrong. The only thing we can use to mitigate this is anticipation.
- Anticipation doesn’t magically make things easier, of course. But we are prepared for them to be as hard as they need to be, as hard as they actually are.
- The Fates guide the person who accepts them and hinder the person who resists them. —CLEANTHES
- You know you’re not the only one who has to accept things you don’t necessarily like, right? It’s part of the human condition. If someone we knew took traffic signals personally, we would judge them insane.
- After you’ve distinguished between the things that are up to you and the things that aren’t (ta eph’hemin, ta ouk eph’hemin), and the break comes down to something you don’t control… you’ve got only one option: acceptance.
- You don’t have to like something to master it—or to use it to some advantage. When the cause of our problem lies outside of us, we are better for accepting it and moving on.
- be. It takes toughness, humility, and will to accept them for what they actually are.
- In a world where we can beam documents around the world in nanoseconds, chat in high-definition video with anyone anywhere, predict the weather down to the minute, it’s very easy to internalize the assumption that nature has been domesticated and submits to our whim. Of course it hasn’t.
- As the saying goes, “Man proposes but God disposes.”
- Follow where the events take you, like water rolling down a hill—it always gets to the bottom eventually, doesn’t it?
- Francis Bacon once said, nature, in order to be commanded, must be obeyed.
- My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it… but love it. — NIETZSCHE
- The next step after we discard our expectations and accept what happens to us, after understanding that certain things—particularly bad things—are outside our control, is this: loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness. It is the act of turning what we must do into what we get to do.
- Should he hate them for hating him? Bitterness was their burden and Johnson refused to pick it up.
- In your worst moments, picture Johnson: always calm, always in control, genuinely loving the opportunity to prove himself, to perform for people, whether they wanted him to succeed or not. Each remark bringing the response it deserved and no more—letting the opponent dig his own grave.
- The goal is: Not: I’m okay with this. Not: I think I feel good about this. But: I feel great about it.
- If the event must occur, Amor fati (a love of fate) is the response.
- There is little reason to delay these feelings. To begrudgingly acknowledge later that it was for the best, when we could have felt that in advance because it was inevitable.
- You love it because it’s all fuel. And you don’t just want fuel. You need it.
- there is always some good—even if only barely perceptible at first—contained within the bad.
- Persistence. Everything directed at one problem, until it breaks.
- Persistence is an action. Perseverance is a matter of will. One is energy. The other, endurance.
- Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield
- To quote Beethoven: “The barriers are not erected which can say to aspiring talents and industry, Thus far and no farther.”
- We can go around or under or backward. We can decide that momentum and defeat are not mutually exclusive—we can keep going, advancing, even if we’ve been stopped in one particular direction.
- A man’s job is to make the world a better place to live in, so far as he is able—always remembering the results will be infinitesimal—and to attend to his own soul. — LEROY PERCY

# How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking

- INTRODUCTION
- Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.
- 1 Everything You Need to Know
- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless
- Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible.
- The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.
- 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected
- Most people try to reduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles or separate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness.
- The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level.
- Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly
- David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001).
- The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way.
- the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective.
- Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together.
- Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.
- 1.2 The Slip-box
- The problems arise when we set up our work in such an inflexible way that we can’t adjust it when things change and become arrested in a process that seems to develop a life of its own.
- The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea.
- Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judo champions.
- 1.3 The slip-box manual
- Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. The notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes. Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box.
- More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of which were nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts.
- He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible.
- The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.
- For example, a note about causality and systems theory carried the number 21/3d7a7 following a note with the number 21/3d7a6 (cf. appendix).
- Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system.
- The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points.
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.
- 2 Everything You Need to Do
- Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.
- If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.
- Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.
- 2.1 Writing a paper step by step
- 1. Make fleeting notes.
- capture every idea that pops into your mind.
- They should not cause any distraction.
- Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later.
- 2. Make literature notes.
- Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing.
- Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system.
- 3. Make permanent notes.
- Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.
- The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
- Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?
- Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible.
- 4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by: a) Filing each one behind one or more related notes
- b) Adding links to related notes.
- c) Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.
- 5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise.
- always take the path that promises the most insight.
- you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered.
- 6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.
- Look through the connections and collect all the relevant notes on this topic (most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order), copy them into an outliner5 and bring them in order.
- 7. Turn your notes into a rough draft.
- Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time.
- 8. Edit and proofread your manuscript.
- Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea generator.
- Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.
- 3 Everything You Need to Have
- Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking.
- 3.1 The Toolbox
- We need four tools: • Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do) • A reference management system (Zotero, Citavi or whatever works best for you) • The slip-box (paper or digital). • An editor (Word, LaTeX, Google Docs or whatever works best for you).
- 1. You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head.
- These notes are not meant to be stored permanently. They will be deleted or chucked soon anyway. They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture the thought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and check facts.
- process it soon, ideally within a day.
- 2. The reference system has two purposes: To collect the references (duh) and the notes you take during your reading.
- 3. The slip-box.
- 4. Finally, the editor: My only recommendation is to choose an editor your reference manager is compatible with
- 4 A Few Things to Keep in Mind
- Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them.
- THE FOUR UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES
- 5 Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters
- Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently.
- the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about.
- It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything.
- Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing
- 6 Simplicity Is Paramount
- We tend to think that big transformations have to start with an equally big idea. But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful
- In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can’t find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store.
- To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes:
- 1. Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two.
- 2. Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either as literature notes in the reference system or written as if for print, in the slip-box.
- 3. Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.
- Only if the notes of these three categories are kept separated will it be possible to build a critical mass of ideas within the slip-box.
- The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort.
- Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.
- These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven’t had the time to elaborate on yet.
- are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.
- A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal.
- In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that cannot be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments.
- The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.
- The last type of note, the ones that are related to only one specific project, are kept together with other project-related notes in a project-specific folder.
- It doesn’t matter in which format these notes are
- Project-related notes can be: • comments in the manuscript • collections of project-related literature • outlines • snippets of drafts • reminders • to-do lists • and of course the draft itself.
- 7 Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch
- When it finally comes to the decision on what to write about, you will already have made the decision – because you made it on every single step along the way, again and again every day, improving it gradually.
- 8 Let the Work Carry You Forward
- exergonic and an endergonic reaction. In the first case, you constantly need to add energy to keep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered, continues by itself and even releases energy.
- The dynamics of work are not so different.
- Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us.
- “growth mindset.” To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative,
- “fixed mindset.” Those who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image might feel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance
- it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure.
- Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding).
- the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia.
- As the feedback loops are usually smaller than one big chunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier to embrace.
- the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information. Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age.
- THE SIX STEPS TO SUCCESSFUL WRITING
- 9 Separate and Interlocking Tasks
- 9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention
- 9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea
- Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task.
- We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.
- “writing” truly means: many different tasks we might end up trying to do at the same time if we don’t separate them consciously and practically.
- Focused attention is different from “sustained attention,” which we need to stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn, understand or get something done.
- 9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention
- When we proofread a manuscript, we take on the role of a critic who takes a step back to see the text with the eyes of a dispassionate reader.
- Letting the inner critic interfere with the author isn’t helpful,
- Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requires a very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on the whole argument.
- It is important, though, to understand outlining not as the preparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need to return to throughout the writing process on a regular basis.
- Some texts need to be read slowly and carefully, while others are only worth skimming. It would be ridiculous to adhere to a general formula and read every text in the same way, even though that is what many study guides or speed-reading courses try to convince us of.
- The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.”
- To be flexible, we need an equally flexible work structure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan.
- One can be the best driver with the quickest reactions, able to adjust flexibly to different street and weather conditions. None of that will help a bit if the driver is stuck on rails.
- 9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner
- “(An) exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement in human performance because of analytical rationality’s slow reasoning and its emphasis on rules, principles, and universal solutions. Second, bodily involvement, speed, and an intimate knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for true expertise.” – Flyvbjerg 2001,
- Experts rely on embodied experience, which enables them to reach the state of virtuosity.
- Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations.
- Because trainees lack the experience to judge a situation correctly and confidently, they need to stick to the rules they were taught, much to the delight of their teachers.
- Experts, on the other hand, have internalised the necessary knowledge so they don’t have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices. They have acquired enough experience in various situations to be able to rely on their intuition to know what to do in which kind of situation.
- Here, gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience.
- 9.5 Get Closure
- The secret to having a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory.
- The first step is to break down the amorphous task of “writing” into smaller pieces of different tasks that can be finished in one go.
- The second step is to make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries.
- 9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions
- “ego depletion”: “We use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reduction in the self’s capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (including controlling the environment, controlling the self, making choices, and initiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.”
- One of the most interesting findings on ego depletion is the broad variety of things that can have a depleting effect.
- “Our results suggest that a broad assortment of actions make use of the same resource. Acts of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after. The implication is that some vital resource of the self becomes depleted by such acts of volition. To be sure, we assume that this resource is commonly replenished, although the factors that might hasten or delay the replenishment remain unknown, along with the precise nature of this resource.” – Baumeister et al., 1998,
- Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the work exactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restore our attention: We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread.
- 10 Read for Understanding
- 10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand
- To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text.
- While the notes themselves are formulated so that they can be understood on their own, they are at the same time embedded in one or more contexts that enrich their meaning.
- Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work using different words – it does not mean the freedom to make something fit.
- Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip.
- don’t turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.
- 10.2 Keep an Open Mind
- the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box.
- And as soon we focus on the content of the slip-box, disconfirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box,
- 10.3 Get the Gist
- “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784)
- 10.4 Learn to Read
- Permanent notes, too, are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field.
- The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe.
- 10.5 Learn by Reading
- the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration.
- Elaboration means nothing other than really thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge.
- Even though elaboration works verifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if you just want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts
- 11 Take Smart Notes
- 11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time
- 11.2 Think Outside the Brain
- A common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought.
- 11.3 Learn by not Trying
- Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition
- Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings.
- We are very dependent on a subconscious mechanism that reliably inhibits almost every memory every moment except the very, very few that are truly helpful in a situation.
- Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between storage capacity and retrieval capacity
- What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes.
- elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way.
- The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.
- If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn.
- 11.4 Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box
- 1. Add a note to the slip-box either behind the note you directly refer to or, if you do not follow up on a specific note, just behind the last note in the slip-box.
- 2. Add links to other notes or links on other notes to your new note.
- 3. Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index.
- 4. Build a latticework of generalised ideas, facts and mental models.
- 12 Develop Ideas
- 12.1 Develop Topics
- Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note.
- Most notes will be found through other notes.
- The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry points.
- The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.
- Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation.
- Assigning keywords is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is a crucial part of the thinking process, which often leads to a deeper elaboration of the note itself and the connection to other notes.
- 12.2 Make Smart Connections
- Luhmann used four basic types of cross-references (Schmidt 2013, 173f; Schmidt 2015, 165f). Only the first and last are relevant for digital versions of the slip-box; the other two are merely compensating for restrictions of the analogue pen and paper version. You don’t need to concern yourself with them if you use the digital program.
- 1. The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you the overview of a topic.
- This kind of note helps to structure thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step towards the development of a manuscript.
- You will know when you need to write one.
- 2. A similar though less crucial kind of link collection is on those notes that give an overview of a local, physical cluster of the slip-box. This is only necessary if you work with pen and paper like Luhmann.
- 3. Equally less relevant for the digital version are those links that indicate the note to which the current note is a follow-up and those links that indicate the note that follows on the current note.
- 4. The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links.
- These links can help us to find surprising connections and similarities between seemingly unrelated topics.
- 12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate
- The constant comparing of notes also serves as an ongoing examination of old notes in a new light.
- 12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking
- looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking.
- A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes.
- If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.
- 12.5 Use the Slip-Box as a Creativity Machine
- The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans than when it focuses.” (Zull 2002,
- 12.6 Think Inside the Box
- “[C]reative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections and seeing things in an original way—seeing things that others cannot see.” – Andreasen 2014.
- To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. We did this when we took literature notes and translated them into the different contexts within the slip-box.
- Abstraction should indeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between step to make heterogeneous ideas compatible.
- Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and always different situations in reality
- Even very personal, intimate experiences, like encounters with art, require abstraction. If the story of Romeo and Juliet touches us, it is certainly not because we are all members of one of two feuding families in Verona. We abstract from time and place, from the particular circumstances until we can meet the protagonists of this story on a general level where our own emotional life can resonate with what we see on stage.
- Another piece of advice is not a feature of the slip-box and might sound banal, but it is crucial: Make sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as plainly and factually as possible.
- our perception does not follow the order of seeing first and interpreting second. It does both at the same time: We always perceive something as something – our interpretation is instantaneous.
- Sometimes, it is more important to rediscover the problems for which we already have a solution than to think solely about the problems that are present to us.
- 12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions
- The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not. Indifference is the worst environment for insight.
- 13 Share Your Insight
- I’m never sure what I think until I see what I write.
- Now you can spread out these notes on your desktop, outline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will make questions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in the argument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work.
- The perspective changes another time: Now, it is not about understanding something in the context of another author’s argument, and it is also not about looking for multiple connections in the slip-box, but about developing one argument and bringing it into the linearity of a manuscript.
- 13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip-box-Storming
- the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment.
- we who have already accompanied our studies by writing and collecting notes in a smart way simply don’t have the need for brainstorming anymore. We can just look into our slip-box instead.
- It is so much easier to see what worked than to predict what might work.
- 13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up
- without intense elaboration on what we already know, we would have trouble seeing its limitations, what is missing or possibly wrong. Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new.
- The more time an artist devotes to learning about an aesthetic “problem,” the more unexpected and creative his solution will be regarded later by art experts (Getzels and Csikszentmihalyi 1976).
- we cannot break with a certain way of thinking if we are not even aware that it is a certain way of thinking (Dean, 2013).
- 13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests
- If we accompany every step of our work with the question, “What is interesting about this?” and everything we read with the question, “What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?” we do not just choose information according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way.
- One could say they finished the plan on what to do the very moment they finished the whole project.
- 13.4 Finishing and Review
- There is not much left to say about the last two steps because the main work is already done.
- A key point: Structure the text and keep it flexible. While the slip-box was very much about experimenting with and generating new ideas, we now need to bring our thoughts into a linear order. The key is to structure the draft visibly.
- The problem in this stage is almost exactly the opposite of the “blank screen.” Instead of not knowing how to fill the pages, we have so much at hand that we have to curb our impulse to mention everything at the same time.
- It is not unusual to change the order of chapters at the very end.
- Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time.
- The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls “verbund.” This is a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomes the resource for another,
- 13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning
- While it doesn’t help to imagine oneself the great author of a successful and timely finished paper, it does make a difference if we have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in our minds.
- 13.6 The Actual Writing
- One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument – “kill your darlings.”
- This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later.
- 14 Make It a Habit
- “It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copybooks and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” – Alfred North Whitehead 1911, 61

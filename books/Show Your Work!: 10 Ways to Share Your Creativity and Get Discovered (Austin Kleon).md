# Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered (Austin Kleon)

- You don’t really find an audience for your work; they find you.
- In order to be found, you have to be findable.
- “The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten.”
- The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.
- Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing.
- Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.
- the only way to find your voice is to use it.
- When a painter talks about her “work,” she could be talking about two different things: There’s the artwork, the finished piece, framed and hung on a gallery wall, and there’s the art work, all the day-to-day stuff that goes on behind the scenes in her studio:
- There’s “painting,” the noun, and there’s “painting,” the verb.
- By letting go of our egos and sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work, which helps us move more of our product.
- Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones.
- The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my head around. Seasons change, weeks are completely human-made, but the day has a rhythm. The sun goes up; the sun goes down. I can handle that.
- Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share.
- If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you.
- If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress.
- If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned.
- Social media sites are the perfect place to share daily updates.
- Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it.
- our audience is a human one, and humans want to connect.
- Sometimes we have to do a lot of cropping and editing to fit our lives into something that resembles a story.
- “Once upon a time, there was _____. Every day, _____. One day, _____. Because of that, _____. Because of that, _____. Until finally, _____.”
- Author John Gardner said the basic plot of nearly all stories is this: “A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition (perhaps including his own doubts), and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw.”
- A good pitch is set up in three acts: The first act is the past, the second act is the present, and the third act is the future. The first act is where you’ve been—what you want, how you came to want it, and what you’ve done so far to get it. The second act is where you are now in your work and how you’ve worked hard and used up most of your resources. The third act is where you’re going, and how exactly the person you’re pitching can help you get there.
- “Whatever we say, we’re always talking about ourselves.” —Alison Bechdel
- The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others.

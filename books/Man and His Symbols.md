# Man and His Symbols

- The importance of dreams
- What we call a symbol is a term, a name, or even a picture that may be familiar in daily life, yet that possesses specific connotations in addition to its conventional and obvious meaning. It implies something vague, unknown, or hidden from us.
- Thus a word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning. It has a wider “unconscious” aspect that is never precisely defined or fully explained.
- As the mind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas that lie beyond the grasp of reason.
- Because there are innumerable things beyond the range of human understanding, we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot define or fully comprehend. This is one reason why all religions employ symbolic language or images. But this conscious use of symbols is only one aspect of a psychological fact of great importance: Man also produces symbols unconsciously and spontaneously, in the form of dreams.
- Man, as we realize if we reflect for a moment, never perceives anything fully or comprehends anything completely.
- No matter what instruments he uses, at some point he reaches the edge of certainty beyond which conscious knowledge cannot pass.
- even when our senses react to real phenomena, sights, and sounds, they are somehow translated from the realm of reality into that of the mind.
- Within the mind they become psychic events, whose ultimate nature is unknowable
- Thus every experience contains an indefinite number of unknown factors,
- As a general rule, the unconscious aspect of any event is revealed to us in dreams, where it appears not as a rational thought but as a symbolic image.
- Consciousness is a very recent acquisition of nature, and it is still in an “experimental” state. It is frail,
- Freud and Josef Breuer had recognized that neurotic symptoms—hysteria, certain types of pain, and abnormal behavior—are in fact symbolically meaningful. They are one way in which the unconscious mind expresses itself, just as it may in dreams; and they are equally symbolic.
- “complexes”—that is, repressed emotional themes that can cause constant psychological disturbances or even, in many cases, the symptoms of a neurosis.
- (The habitual complexes are the tender spots of the psyche, which react most quickly to an external stimulus or disturbance.)
- A story told by the conscious mind has a beginning, a development, and an end, but the same is not true of a dream. Its dimensions in time and space are quite different; to understand it you must examine it from every aspect—just
- only the material that is clearly and visibly part of a dream should be used in interpreting it. The dream has its own limitation.
- The two fundamental points in dealing with dreams are these: First, the dream should be treated as a fact, about which one must make no previous assumption except that it somehow makes sense; and second, the dream is a specific expression of the unconscious.
- But when something slips out of our consciousness it does not cease to exist, any more than a car that has disappeared round a corner has vanished into thin air.
- I am speaking here of things we have consciously seen or heard, and subsequently forgotten. But we all see, hear, smell, and taste many things without noticing them at the time, either because our attention is deflected or because the stimulus to our senses is too slight to leave a conscious impression. The unconscious, however, has taken note of them, and such subliminal sense perceptions play a significant part in our everyday lives. Without our realizing it, they influence the way in which we react to both events and people.
- Many people mistakenly overestimate the role of will power and think that nothing can happen to their minds that they do not decide and intend. But one must learn to discriminate carefully between intentional and unintentional contents of the mind. The former are derived from the ego personality; the latter, however, arise from a source that is not identical with the ego, but is its “other side.”
- just as conscious contents can vanish into the unconscious, new contents, which have never yet been conscious, can arise from it.
- in addition to memories from a long-distant conscious past, completely new thoughts and creative ideas can also present themselves from the unconscious—thoughts and ideas that have never been conscious before. They grow up from the dark depths of the mind like a lotus and form a most important part of the subliminal psyche.
- The images produced in dreams are much more picturesque and vivid than the concepts and experiences that are their waking counterparts. One of the reasons for this is that, in a dream, such concepts can express their unconscious meaning.
- many dreams present images and associations that are analogous to primitive ideas, myths, and rites.
- I found that associations and images of this kind are an integral part of the unconscious, and can be observed everywhere—whether
- and they are especially valuable (as Dr. Henderson shows in a later chapter of this book) just because of their “historical” nature.
- They form a bridge between the ways in which we consciously express our thoughts and a more primitive, more colorful and pictorial form of expression.
- I have already discussed the interesting contrast between the “controlled” thoughts we have in waking life and the wealth of imagery produced in dreams. Now you can see another reason for this difference: Because, in our civilized life, we have stripped so many ideas of their emotional energy, we do not really respond to them any more.
- Something more is needed to bring certain things home to us effectively enough to make us change our attitude and our behavior. That is what “dream language” does; its symbolism has so much psychic energy that we are forced to pay attention to it.
- The more that consciousness is influenced by prejudices, errors, fantasies, and infantile wishes, the more the already existing gap will widen into a neurotic dissociation and lead to a more or less artificial life far removed from healthy instincts, nature, and truth.
- The general function of dreams is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing dream material that re-establishes, in a subtle way, the total psychic equilibrium.
- It explains why people who have unrealistic ideas or too high an opinion of themselves, or who make grandiose plans out of proportion to their real capacities, have dreams of flying or falling.
- One cannot afford to be naïve in dealing with dreams. They originate in a spirit that is not quite human, but is rather a breath of nature—a spirit of the beautiful and generous as well as of the cruel goddess.
- The recurring dream is a noteworthy phenomenon.
- A dream of this kind is usually an attempt to compensate for a particular defect in the dreamer’s attitude to life; or it may date from a traumatic moment that has left behind some specific prejudice. It may also sometimes anticipate a future event of importance.
- The sign is always less than the concept it represents, while a symbol always stands for something more than its obvious and immediate meaning.
- No one can take a more or less rational thought, reached as a logical conclusion or by deliberate intent, and then give it “symbolic” form. No matter what fantastic trappings one may put upon an idea of this kind, it will still remain a sign, linked to the conscious thought behind it, not a symbol that hints at something not yet known.
- “Learn as much as you can about symbolism; then forget it all when you are analyzing a dream.”
- the particular message of a dream (that is, the contribution that the unconscious is making to the conscious mind)
- The individual is the only reality. The further we move away from the individual toward abstract ideas about Homo sapiens, the more likely we are to fall into error.
- Because psychology basically depends upon balanced opposites, no judgment can be considered to be final in which its reversibility has not been taken into account.
- the people who used their minds were those who thought—that is, who applied their intellectual faculty in trying to adapt themselves to people and circumstances.
- Feeling according to this definition is not an emotion (which, as the word conveys, is involuntary). Feeling as I mean it is (like thinking) a rational (i.e., ordering) function, whereas intuition is an irrational (i.e., perceiving) function.
- These four functional types correspond to the obvious means by which consciousness obtains its orientation to experience. Sensation (i.e., sense perception) tells you that something exists; thinking tells you what it is; feeling tells you whether it is agreeable or not; and intuition tells you whence it comes and where it is going.

# 50 Psychology Classics Second Edition: Your shortcut to the most important ideas on the mind, personality, and human nature (50 Classics)

- Adler saw us as social beings who create a style of life in response to the environment and to what we feel we lack.
- Like Freud, Adler believed that the human psyche is shaped in early childhood, and that patterns of behavior remain remarkably constant into maturity. But while Freud focused on infantile sexuality, Adler was more interested in how children seek to increase their power in the world. Growing into an environment in which everyone else seems bigger and more powerful, every child seeks to gain what they need by the easiest route.
- A fork in the developmental path leads a child either to imitate adults in order to become more assertive and powerful themselves, or consciously to display weakness so as to get adult help and attention.
- In short, every child develops in ways that best allow them to compensate for weakness;
- The psyche’s attempt to banish a sense of inferiority will often shape someone’s whole life; the person will try to compensate for it in sometimes extreme ways. Adler invented a term for this, the famous “inferiority com-plex.”
- While a complex may make someone more timid or withdrawn, it could equally produce the need to compensate for that in overachievement. This is the “pathological power drive,” expressed at the expense of other people and society generally.
- “Character” is the unique interplay between two opposing forces: a need for power, or personal aggrandizement; and a need for “social feeling” and togetherness
- When the first force, social feeling and community expectation, is ignored or affronted, the person concerned will reveal certain aggressive character traits: vanity, ambition, envy, jealousy, playing God, or greed; or nonaggressive traits: withdrawal, anxiety, timidity, or absence of social graces.
- Such people live “in the expectation of great triumphs” to compensate for those feelings, but as a result of their inflated sense of self lose some sense of reality.
- They forget that they are human beings with ties to other people.
- Vain people, by their nature, do not allow themselves to “give in” to society’s needs. In their focus on achieving a certain standing, position, or object, they feel that they can shirk the normal obligations to the community or family that others take for granted.
- Adler had a teleological view—that we are driven by our goals, whether they are conscious or not.
